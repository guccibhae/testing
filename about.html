        <p>LEAD SKILLS TRAINER</p>

        <p>
          Before becoming a skills trainer, Mustapha attended Bordentown Regional
          HS, where he played all four years. In his sophomore year was named
          offensive player of the year award because of his proficiency and
          skill level to create for himself and his teammates. He continued his
          career at Bordentown Regional HS as a prolific scorer. He also went on
          to play collegiate ball and have a taste for every division level, he
          did a little bit of everything over his coaching/training experience.
          <br />He has coached, the Central Jersey Jammers, a travel basketball
          organization located in New Brunswick, NJ for about 3 years.

        <p>
          This was a great learning experience for him dealing with all age
          groups and being able to commence small group clinics for player
          development was a plus, especially for players preparing themselves
          for the upcoming season. The highest level of coaching for him is on
          the Amateur athletic union level. He worked with his local gym as a
          private skills trainer for basketball and trained anyone that was a
          member/nonmember. Heâ€™s fortunate to work players of all ages, levels,
          and abilities to help motivate and guide them along their journey.

        <p>
          Mustapha has a professional skill level to demonstrate for his players
          but also the knowledge needed to improve every aspect of their game.
